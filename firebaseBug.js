The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is malformed or missing required fields.  For example, if the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`, and `measurementId` fields are missing or incorrect, initialization will fail, and subsequent calls to Firebase services will result in errors. This is particularly common when dealing with environment variables or configuration files where typos or incorrect values can easily occur. Additionally, inconsistent naming of environment variables when dealing with multiple Firebase projects can lead to errors.
