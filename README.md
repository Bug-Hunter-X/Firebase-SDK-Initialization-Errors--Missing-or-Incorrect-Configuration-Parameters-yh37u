This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when initializing the Firebase SDK: errors caused by incorrect or missing configuration parameters. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the error scenario where missing or incorrect configuration values prevent successful initialization. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution: proper configuration of the Firebase SDK using correctly formatted and complete configuration parameters obtained securely (e.g., from environment variables or a secure configuration service).  Understanding and addressing these configuration issues is critical for ensuring the reliable operation of your Firebase applications.
